                  <h2>Few Facts About The Church of Christ and its' Origin</h2>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Jesus Christ is the Head and Founder of the Church -- Matthew 16:16-18</li>
                     <li>The same church that Isaiah prophesied about some 750 years before its establishment -- Isaiah 2:2-3</li>
                     <li>The same church Micah prophesied about in 710 B.C. -- Micah 4:1-2</li>
                     <li>The same church that Daniel fortold about 600 years before its establishment -- Daniel 2:31-45</li>
                     <li>The same church Zechariah said would be established in Jerusalem -- Zechariah 1:16</li>
                     <li>The same church that Joel prohesied about -- Joel 2:28-32</li>
                     <li>The same church that Jesus promised would be established in Jerusalem during His lifetime -- Mark 9:1 Luke 24:47</li>
                     <li>The same church that became established in Jerusalem on May 28, A.D. 30 -- Acts 2</li>
                     <li>The church that Christ gave his life for -- Ephesians 5:2-5</li>
                     <li>The One and Only church that is in the Bible -- Romans 16:16; 1Corinthians 1:2</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The New Testament is the only place to which we can turn to learn about the church of Christ and its' worship. We can recall that the church is described as the eternal purpose of God (Ephesians 3:9-11). It is necessary, therefore, that we are educated by the New Testament and not by the ideas of men.<br>The New Testament teaches us what the church is, and what the church should be today, according to the plan of God. The church has a divinely appointed mission (Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-16). In submitting to the Lord’s authority, Christians ought to worship according to the New Testament (John 4:24; Colossians 3:16-17). In subjecting themselves to the headship of Jesus, congregations of the Lord’s church must govern themselves according to the New Testament teaching.
                     If Christ is the head of the church, we can not implement our own worship styles or leadership preferences. Christ is mindful of what goes on within his congregation. He will discipline them and he will consider them apostate if they persist in unscriptural practices (Revelation 2:5; 2 Johnn 9).
